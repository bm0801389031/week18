## isograms, first function

Description:
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

isIsogram("Dermatoglyphics") == true
isIsogram("aba") == false
isIsogram("moOse") == false // -- ignore letter case

## square, second function

Description:
A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

## shortest word, third function


Description:
Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

## jaden casing strings, fourth function

Description:
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

## exes and ohs, fifth function

Description:
Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

Examples input/output:

XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false

## complementary DNA, sixth function

Description:
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

DNAStrand ("ATTGC") // return "TAACG"

DNAStrand ("GTAT") // return "CATA"

## list filtered, seventh function

Description:
In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Example
filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

## sum of numbers, eighth function

Description:
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Examples
GetSum(1, 0) == 1   // 1 + 0 = 1
GetSum(1, 2) == 3   // 1 + 2 = 3
GetSum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1
GetSum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same
GetSum(-1, 0) == -1 // -1 + 0 = -1
GetSum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2

## credit card mask, ninth function

Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

Examples
maskify("4556364607935616") == "############5616"
maskify(     "64607935616") ==      "#######5616"
maskify(               "1") ==                "1"
maskify(                "") ==                 ""

// "What was the name of your first pet?"
maskify("Skippy")                                   == "##ippy"
maskify("Nananananananananananananananana Batman!") == "####################################man!"
